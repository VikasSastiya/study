Let me explain **Public IP**, **Private IP**, and **Elastic IP** in **very simple language** with an **example**:

* * *

### ✅ 1. **Private IP** – For inside the house (your private network)

* *   It's like the name of a **room inside your house**.
*     
* *   Used **inside your network** (e.g., between your phone, computer, and router).
*     
* *   **Not visible to the outside world (internet)**.
*     

**Example:**  
Your phone has IP `192.168.1.5` when connected to Wi-Fi – this is a private IP.

* * *

### ✅ 2. **Public IP** – Your house’s address (seen on the internet)

* *   It’s like your **home address** that others can see and use to send you things.
*     
* *   Used when your system needs to **communicate over the internet**.
*     
* *   Given by your **ISP** or **cloud provider** (like AWS).
*     

**Example:**  
When you search “What is my IP?” on Google, it shows your public IP.

* * *

### ✅ 3. **Elastic IP (in AWS)** – A public IP that **never changes**

* *   It’s a **special kind of public IP** in AWS.
*     
* *   It is **static** (does not change if you stop/start your instance).
*     
* *   You can **assign it to any EC2 instance**.
*     

**Example in AWS:**

* *   You launch an EC2 instance → it gets a temporary public IP.
*     
* *   If you stop/start the instance → that IP changes.
*     
* *   But if you attach an **Elastic IP**, it will **always remain the same**.
*     
* *   Useful when you want your server to always be reachable at the same address.
*
